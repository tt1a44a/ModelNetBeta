# Discord Bot Module Import Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Module Import Error**: Fixed the `No module named 'utils'` error by:
   - Updating import statements in `consolidated_commands.py` and `register_consolidated_commands.py` to use multiple import strategies
   - Adding fallback paths to ensure the modules can be found regardless of how the script is run

2. **Command Registration**: Improved the command registration system by:
   - Creating a proper `register_all_commands` function in `register_commands.py`
   - Implementing a fallback mechanism that will use traditional command registration if consolidated commands fail
   - Ensuring commands are properly stored in the `registered_commands` dictionary

3. **Dependencies Setup**: Created a `setup_dependencies.sh` script that:
   - Sets up a virtual environment
   - Installs required packages
   - Creates template configuration files

## Remaining Issues

1. **Import Resolution**: The import system might still have issues depending on how Python resolves module paths:
   - May need to add an empty `__init__.py` file to make the directory a proper Python package
   - Consider using absolute imports consistently throughout the codebase

2. **Command Registration**: All commands should be properly stored in the `registered_commands` dictionary:
   - Make sure that commands like `help_command` and `history_command` are properly stored
   - Update all command implementations to use the same pattern

3. **Environment Configuration**: Make sure the `.env` file contains all necessary variables:
   - Update the bot token
   - Configure the database connection properly

## How to Run

1. **Setup Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   ./setup_dependencies.sh
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**:
   Edit the `.env` file to include your Discord bot token and database settings.

3. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python discord_bot.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Import Errors**: If you encounter import errors, check:
   - The directory structure
   - That all dependencies are installed
   - That you're running from the correct directory

2. **Command Registration Errors**: If commands aren't registering:
   - Check the logs for specific errors
   - Verify that command functions follow the expected signature
   - Ensure all required parameters are provided

3. **Database Connection Errors**: If database connections fail:
   - Verify the database settings in `.env`
   - Check that the database server is running and accessible
   - Make sure the required database tables are created
