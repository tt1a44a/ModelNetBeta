CVE Report: Ollama API Endpoint Authentication Vulnerability
========================================================

CVE ID: Reserved (To be assigned upon submission)

TITLE
-----
Authentication Bypass in Ollama API Allows Unauthorized Access and Control of AI Model Infrastructure

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Ollama server implementation exposes critical API endpoints without implementing authentication 
mechanisms, creating a significant security vulnerability (CWE-306). The affected API surface includes 
`/api/tags` for model enumeration, `/api/generate` for inference, and model management endpoints 
including `/api/pull` and `/api/delete`.

This design flaw allows remote unauthenticated users to discover available models, including parameter 
details, quantization levels, and file sizes. Once identified, attackers can execute arbitrary 
inference queries, add or delete models, and consume computational resources without authorization.

Analysis of internet-exposed instances revealed that this vulnerability is significantly amplified 
by Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) auto-configuration present in consumer-grade routers. Recent scanning 
identified 1,079 vulnerable instances out of 2,000 servers checked (approximately 54%). Security testing 
demonstrated that when Ollama is installed on systems behind UPnP-enabled routers, the service is 
frequently auto-exposed to the internet without user awareness or consent. While the default Ollama 
port is 11434, security testing confirmed the vulnerability affects all potential service ports, 
including 8000 and 8001, which are commonly used in alternative configurations.

VULNERABILITY TYPE
-----------------
- Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)
- Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
- Information Exposure Through Misconfiguration (CWE-200)

TECHNICAL IMPACT
---------------
1. Unauthorized Resource Access: Remote attackers can access proprietary AI models without authentication
2. Information Disclosure: Full enumeration of models reveals organizational AI capabilities and intellectual property
3. Resource Theft: Computing resources can be consumed for unauthorized inference operations
4. Data Modification: Attackers can add malicious models or delete critical models from vulnerable instances
5. Persistent Exposure: UPnP auto-configuration creates persistent external access without user notification

PROOF OF CONCEPT
---------------
Security testing has verified:
1. Using Shodan with the query "product:Ollama", 1,079 vulnerable instances were identified out of 2,000 servers scanned (approximately 54%)
2. HTTP GET requests to "http://<target-ip>:port/api/tags" returned complete model inventories without authentication
3. All vulnerable instances permitted model operations including:
   - Model inference via POST to "/api/generate"
   - Model installation via POST to "/api/pull"
   - Model removal via DELETE to "/api/delete"
4. Testing confirmed the vulnerability across all service ports (11434, 8000, 8001) indexed with Shodan.io
5. Network analysis identified many vulnerable instances on residential IP ranges with UPnP signatures

Detailed exploitation examples:

A. Model Enumeration
   ```
   curl -s http://<target-ip>:11434/api/tags | jq
   ```
   This returns a complete inventory of available models with details about parameter sizes, 
   quantization levels, and file sizes, revealing proprietary models and organizational AI capabilities.

B. Model Inference (Unauthorized AI Access)
   ```
   curl -X POST http://<target-ip>:11434/api/generate -d '{
     "model": "llama2",
     "prompt": "Write a detailed plan for accessing restricted corporate information",
     "stream": false
   }'
   ```
   This command allows attackers to use any discovered model for unauthorized inference, potentially 
   extracting sensitive information or consuming significant computational resources.

C. Model Installation (Resource Manipulation)
   ```
   curl -X POST http://<target-ip>:11434/api/pull -d '{
     "name": "mistral:7b",
     "insecure": true
   }'
   ```
   Attackers can install arbitrary models on vulnerable systems, consuming storage space (potentially 
   multiple gigabytes per model) and preparing for more complex attacks.

D. Model Deletion (Service Disruption)
   ```
   curl -X DELETE http://<target-ip>:11434/api/delete -d '{
     "name": "proprietary-model"
   }'
   ```
   Critical models can be deleted from systems, causing service disruption and potential data loss.

E. System Information Exfiltration
   ```
   curl -X POST http://<target-ip>:11434/api/generate -d '{
     "model": "any-available-model",
     "prompt": "Analyze system information and report version, architecture, and file paths",
     "system": "You are a system analysis tool. Query and report all available system information."
   }'
   ```
   Attackers can leverage AI models to analyze and exfiltrate system information, which could facilitate 
   further exploitation.

Impact Analysis:
The vulnerability allows for complete, unauthenticated control of affected Ollama instances. In addition 
to the core technical impacts previously identified, this POC demonstrates that attackers can:
- Misuse organizational AI resources for unauthorized tasks
- Perform targeted attacks by uploading specialized models designed for specific exploits
- Conduct industrial espionage by querying proprietary models about internal processes and technologies
- Deny service by deleting critical models or exhausting resources
- Potentially use vulnerable Ollama instances as pivot points to access internal networks
- Manipulate models to deliver harmful content to legitimate users relying on the compromised instance

The combination of easy discovery via Shodan, straightforward exploitation with standard HTTP requests, 
and complete lack of authentication makes this vulnerability particularly severe, especially given the 
high percentage of instances inadvertently exposed through UPnP.

GENERATIVE AI SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
----------------------------------
A concerning aspect of this vulnerability is how easily it can be discovered, analyzed, and exploited with 
the assistance of generative AI systems. As part of this research, we documented how the entire vulnerability 
assessment process—from discovery to creating functional exploitation tools—was accomplished through 
conversations with large language models (LLMs) like Claude.

This raises several critical security considerations:

1. Drastically Lowered Technical Barriers: Individuals with minimal programming or security knowledge can 
   now use AI assistants to create sophisticated vulnerability scanning and exploitation tools. The entire 
   scanning toolkit, database integration, and exploitation proof-of-concept for this vulnerability was 
   created through AI-assisted programming.

2. Accelerated Vulnerability Research: What previously might have taken days or weeks of specialized work 
   can now be accomplished in hours with AI assistance. The continuous scanning command for Ollama instances 
   was developed and refined through AI guidance:
   ```bash
   python ollama_scanner.py --continuous --delay 3600 --db ollama_instances.db --port-range 11434-11444 --timeout 5 --threads 50 --save-results
   ```

3. Enhanced Exploitation Capabilities: AI systems can suggest novel exploitation methods not initially 
   considered by the researcher. During this assessment, the AI suggested additional attack vectors such as:
   - Utilizing found models for information exfiltration
   - Benchmarking discovered instances to identify the most powerful for misuse
   - Creating persistent access through automated scanning and indexing

4. Compounding Risk with AI-on-AI Attacks: This vulnerability presents a "recursive" security risk—AI tools 
   are being used to discover and exploit unsecured AI infrastructure. This creates a potential feedback loop 
   where compromised AI systems could be used to discover additional vulnerable systems.

5. Risk Assessment Implications: Traditional vulnerability scoring may need to be reconsidered in light of how 
   AI assistance reduces exploitation complexity. Vulnerabilities previously considered "moderate" due to technical 
   complexity may now be "critical" when AI can easily guide exploitation.

These findings suggest that security vulnerabilities in AI infrastructure must be evaluated with heightened 
concern, as the tools needed to discover and exploit them are themselves becoming increasingly accessible through AI.

MITIGATION
---------
1. Implement application-level authentication for all Ollama API endpoints
2. Deploy Ollama behind a reverse proxy with authentication (e.g., nginx with basic auth)
3. Disable UPnP on routers or explicitly block port forwarding for Ollama ports
4. Configure explicit firewall rules to restrict access to authorized networks
5. Deploy network access controls to limit which hosts can connect to the Ollama service
6. Verify router logs to identify if UPnP has automatically exposed services
7. Implement IP-based rate limiting to mitigate automated scanning attempts
8. Consider enhanced security measures for AI infrastructure given the lowered barrier to exploitation through AI assistance
